## Dataset

>   The dataset used in this Exploration project reports flights in the United States, including carriers, arrival and departure delays, and reasons for delays, and so on. The information contained in this dataset was tracked by the U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS). Dataset from 2008 was used in this project which contains approximately 2.4 million rows of data. The data can be downloaded from here and the discription is provided here.  


## Summary of Findings

**I was Interested in investigating and finding out about:**

- What major factors are causing flights arrival and departure delay?
- Is distance a major determinants of delayed flights?
- Are flights delay due to the unique carriers?
- Are they any other interesting patterns that affected delayed flights?

**After exploring the dataset, I concluded from my findings that:**

- Only a percentage of 22.22% of flights had Departure delay, which means most flights were not delayed on departure.
- From the pie chart that showed the relation between cancelled and not cancelled flights, we noted that;
Cancelled Flights accounts for 2.70% of the data, whose major cause was the Carrier and weather condition which accounts for about 40% each.
- Also, 25.77% of flights arrived late, that is the flights arrived 15 minutes later than the scheduled time
- It was noted after looking at the relation between Average Delay for year 2008 and the Reasons for delay that Late Aircraft, was a major reason for flights delay, followed by National Airspace System, Carrier, Weather, etc. It was also noted that Security had an insignificant effect on Delayed flights. This means that the security responsibilities were done properly and was not a major cause for flights delay
- Out of the 20 Airlines, it was noted that only the American Airline inc. had an Average delay greater than 15 minutes on it's arrival. Also, the American airlines inc. along with the United AirLines inc. had an average delay greater than 15 minutes on departure delay.
- The multivariate analysis revealed to us that Late Aircraft, NAS and Carrier were major determinants of delayed flights for American Airlines and United Airlines inc.



## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I started with the Univariate distribution of plots that shows the major findings from the Univariate exploration of the dataset, which is the Arrival and Departure Delay barchart and pie chart, and also the plot that shows the Reasons For Delay.

Afterwards, bivariate exploration by investigating relations between pairs of variables in the dataset with adapted bar charts.

Lastly, Multivariate exploration by creating plots that shows the relation between three or more variables to investigate the data even further, I was intersted only in the reasons for Delay for the two flights that had average delay value for Arrival and/or departure delay variables greater than 15 minutes.
